# Internship-task-2
Explored the Titanic dataset using Google Colab. Performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations (age distribution, survival by class/age, heatmap). Gained hands-on practice with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my **Internship Day 2 task**, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Google Colab.

## 📌 Objective
To understand patterns and insights from the Titanic dataset using Python libraries and visual tools.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed
- Loaded the dataset using Google Colab
- Explored data structure, types, and missing values
- Analyzed statistical summaries
- Visualized data:
  - Age distribution histogram
  - Survival vs Age (Boxplot)
  - Survival count by passenger class
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Pairplot of key numeric features

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`: Colab notebook with full EDA
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Titanic dataset used (optional)
- `README.md`: Project description

## ✅ Outcome
Completed a basic end-to-end EDA pipeline and improved hands-on skills in data analysis using Python and Colab.
